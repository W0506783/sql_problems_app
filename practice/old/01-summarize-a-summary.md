## The "Summarize a Summary" (Histogram) Pattern

This SQL pattern is used when you need to perform a two-level aggregation...

### Example Question: Histogram of Tweets
### https://datalemur.com/questions/sql-histogram-tweets

Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.

In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group.

### tweets Table:

| Column Name | Type |
|:---|:---|
| tweet_id | integer |
| user_id | integer |
| msg | string |
| tweet_date | timestamp |

### tweets Example input:

| tweet_id | user_id | msg | tweet_date |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 5 | 111 |Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.|12/30/2021 00:00:00|
| 1 | 111 |Despite the constant negative press covfefe|01/01/2022 00:00:00|
| 2 | 111 |Following @NickSinghTech on Twitter changed my life!|02/14/2022 00:00:00|
| 4| 254 |If the salary is so competitive why wonâ€™t you tell me what it is?|03/01/2022 00:00:00|
| 3 | 148 |I no longer have a manager. I can't be managed|03/23/2022 00:00:00|

### Example Final Output:

| tweet bucket | users_num |
|:---|:---|
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 1 |

### Explanation:

Based on the example output, there are two users who posted only one tweet in 2022, and one user who posted two tweets in 2022. The query groups the users by the number of tweets they posted and displays the number of users in each group.

```SQL 

WITH tweets_per_user AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id, 
    COUNT(tweet_id) AS tweet_count
  FROM 
    "01_tweets" -- Need "" here because dumb decision to use q# prefix
  WHERE 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM tweet_date) = 2022
  GROUP BY 
    user_id
)

SELECT
  tweet_count AS tweet_bucket,
  COUNT(user_id) AS users_num
FROM
  tweets_per_user
GROUP BY
  tweet_count
ORDER BY

## Deconstruction:

### Core Tasks

1. **Filtering**: We only care about tweets from the year 2022
2. **Counting Tweets Per User**: We need to count how many tweets each user has posted
3. **Creating a Histogram**: We need to group the users by the *number of tweets they posted* and then count the number of users in each of those groups

### This multi-step process, where the result of one aggregation (counting tweets per user) is used in a subsequent aggregation (counting users in each tweet-count group), is a strong indicator that a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a subquery would be beneficial for clarity and organization. Using a CTE makes the logic easier to read and follow.

### This also brings us back to the pattern: we're Summarizing a Summary or "Aggregating an Aggregation"

### Now think about order of operations. In this case since we are going to use a CTE we will begin with a `WITH` clause. `WITH` is not in our order of operations because it is just presumed that it comes before the main query and therefore comes first.

### However, we can go to our order of operations WITHIN the CTE

The `WITH` clause, which defines the Common Table Expression (CTE) named `tweets_per_user`, is processed first. 

- Inside the CTE, using OOP (Order of Operations) we think of the `FROM` clause which identifies the `tweets` table.
- The `WHERE` clause filters this table to only include tweets from 2022.
- The `GROUP BY` clause then groups the remaining rows by `user_id`.
- The `SELECT` statement within the CTE, with the `COUNT` function, calculates the number of tweets for each user.

```SQL
WITH tweets_per_user AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id, 
    COUNT(tweet_id) AS tweet_count
  FROM 
    tweets
  WHERE 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM tweet_date) = 2022
  GROUP BY 
    user_id
)

```
</details>

At the end of this CTE, we have a temporary table (tweets_per_user) that looks something like this:

|user_id|tweet_count|
|:---|:---|
|111|2|
|148|1|
|254|1|

The main query then executes, using the temporary `tweets_per_user` result set as its source table.

- The `FROM` clause in the outer query references `tweets_per_user`.
- The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results from the CTE by the `tweet_count`.
- The `SELECT` statement then counts the number of users (`user_id`) within each of these groups.
- The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the final result set.
