## Join Two Tables: Customers and Orders

**Problem:**
You have two tables: `customers` (with `id`, `name`) and `orders` (with `id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, `amount`).
Write a SQL query that retrieves the customer's name and the amount of all orders they have placed.

**Expected Output:**
Rows containing `customer_name` and `order_amount` for all orders, showing the corresponding customer's name.
