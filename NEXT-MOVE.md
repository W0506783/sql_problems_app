cool it seems to work. is there a way to set up 3 things: I need it to be blank when i go back to the screen or reload it. should just start with a blank cursor. also it doesn't display the result below, there's two buttons a run button to display results then a submit button when you finally submit your results. i guess i need the run button to also happen? and thirdly looking for a way to hopefully be able to add commands within Code Mirror like Ctrl+z to undo last thing you typed etc

1. Start with a Blank Cursor on Reload / Go Back

Problem: When reloading the page or going back, the user_query field is still populated because you're persisting it in session.

Fix:

You’re currently doing:

'user_query': request.session.pop('user_query', ''),


That’s great for preserving the query after a submit, but if you want a blank slate on page load (GET), you should avoid setting user_query at all during normal page load.

✅ Solution:

Only store/retrieve user_query from session during submission, not general load.

So change this:

'user_query': request.session.pop('user_query', ''),


To:

'user_query': '',  # Always blank on reload


But in the 'submit' branch, where you currently have:

request.session['user_query'] = user_query


You can remove that line unless you explicitly want to repopulate the query after an incorrect submission.

✅ 2. Display Query Results After "Run" Button Is Clicked

Problem: You said results don’t show after pressing “Run”.

You already have logic in this section:

if action == 'run':
    ...
    context['query_results'] = user_query_cursor.fetchall()
    context['column_headers'] = [col[0] for col in user_query_cursor.description] if user_query_cursor.description else []


This is correct, so the issue is likely in your HTML template: it might not be showing results stored in query_results and column_headers.

✅ Solution:

In your template (practice/problem_detail.html), make sure you have something like this:

{% if query_results %}
    <h3>Results:</h3>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                {% for header in column_headers %}
                    <th>{{ header }}</th>
                {% endfor %}
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            {% for row in query_results %}
                <tr>
                    {% for cell in row %}
                        <td>{{ cell }}</td>
                    {% endfor %}
                </tr>
            {% endfor %}
        </tbody>
    </table>
{% endif %}


Also make sure you’re actually passing context into the render method as you are — looks good from your view code.

✅ 3. Add CodeMirror Features Like Ctrl+Z (Undo)

Problem: You want editing features like Ctrl+Z in your CodeMirror SQL editor.

✅ Solution:

Good news: CodeMirror already supports undo/redo (Ctrl+Z / Cmd+Z) by default — but only if:

You are using the full CodeMirror editor (not just a text area).

You're not disabling the default key bindings.

If you're not seeing undo/redo working, here’s a checklist:

✅ Make sure:

You initialize CodeMirror properly.

You don’t override keymaps without including the basic ones.

✅ Example CodeMirror Initialization (for SQL):
<textarea id="code" name="user_query">{{ user_query }}</textarea>

<script>
    const editor = CodeMirror.fromTextArea(document.getElementById("code"), {
        mode: "text/x-sql",
        theme: "default", // or another theme
        lineNumbers: true,
        extraKeys: {
            "Ctrl-Space": "autocomplete",
            "Ctrl-/": "toggleComment"
            // Do NOT override Ctrl+Z or Ctrl+Y unless needed
        }
    });

    // Optional: Assign to a global so you can debug or reset
    window.sqlEditor = editor;
</script>


Undo/Redo (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z / Ctrl+Y) should now work automatically.

| Goal                    | Solution                                                             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blank cursor on reload  | Remove `session`-based `user_query` unless needed for error feedback |
| Run query shows results | Add result table rendering logic in the template                     |
| Ctrl+Z for undo         | Use proper CodeMirror setup, don't override default keybindings      |
